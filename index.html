                    <h2>Teen Health Issue - Weight Loss Pill</h2>
					<h3>1. What is a weight loss pill?</h3>
                    <p>- Weight loss pills are made in many forms such as pills, weight loss tea, weight loss coffee, weight loss candy, weight loss chocolate. Producers create the weight loss pill in the form of coffee, candy, or chocolate to attract the attention of teens. It will make teens curious why eating candy, chocolate, or drinking coffee can help them lose weight.  
					</p>
                    <p>
                        - Weight loss drugs can be divided into 3 main categories, drugs that fill the digestive tract, drugs that cause anorexia, and drugs that metabolize fat in the body. All these drugs have harmful side effects on the health of people who use weight loss pills.</p>

                    <p>- The first type is weight loss pills that fill the digestive tract, it contains methylcellulose and sterculia in the drug. These substances are not absorbed into the blood, but only stay in the intestinal lumen and absorb water. Then it causes swelling and bloating in the stomach and it makes people not feel hungry.
                    </p>
					<p>
					- The second type is the drug that enhances fat metabolism contains the thyroid hormone thyroxine, which is a substance capable of increasing fat metabolism. It has the risk of damaging the heart and causing cardiovascular diseases.
					</p>
					<p>
					- The last drugs that cause anorexia contain ingredients such as benzedrine, phenomena, amphetamine. These substances act on the central nervous system, causing difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, loss of hunger, and unwillingness to eat, causing the people who used it to become depressed and tired.
					</p>
                    <h2>2.How does weight loss pills affect teens?</h2>
					<p>- The first harmful effects of weight loss pills show up on the outside is your skin. When you try to lose weight, your skin is deprived of moisture and nutrients. Gradually, the protein fibers are broken and it's causing the skin to dry, dull, melasma, and appear freckles. According to dermatologists, when the body weight decreases by 1.5 kg per week, it will cause severe damage to the skin structure. Since then the skin loses its elasticity and is difficult to restore to its original state.</p>
					<p>- Taking weight loss pills for a long time will make users addicted to weight loss pills. When they stop taking the weight loss pills, their weight will return to normal. When the weight returns to normal, teens will continue to use weight loss pills and they will not want to stop because they do not want to gain weight.  </p>
					<p>- According to researchers from Vanderbilt University, they did some research and the result showed that weight loss pills can cause stress, anxiety, aggressive behavior, or mood swings. All weight loss pills have negative side effects on human mental and emotional health. In severe cases, people with side effects are at risk of exhibiting extreme behaviors, self-harm, and even suicide.</p>
					<p>- According to the FDA, there were 69 weight loss pills made from substances that are unsafe for our bodies. Weight loss pills work by heating up the body, increasing metabolism, causing the body to burn fat at a higher rate to accelerate the effect of weight loss. Although these substances will help your body to lose weight, they will bring many bad side effects to your body including heart attacks, fainting, or increased heart rate. Moreover, when your heart rate and blood pressure increase, it will adversely affect sleep, make you not sleep well or startle.</p>
					<h2>3. What are some misunderstandings that teens have about the issue?</h2>
					<p>- Teens usually think that when they take the weight loss pill, they don't have to exercise. The weight loss pill will help them to reduce the calories and fat in their body. But it is a misunderstanding that teens usually have. If we want to lose weight we should do exercise every day so it will reduce the fat in our body. Moreover, many people think that the more weight loss pills you take, the faster you will lose weight. But it definitely is a misconception of teens and when you take more weight loss pills in a day than prescribed, your body will be harmed by the weight loss pills.</p>
					<h2>4. How it can be prevented.</h2>
					<p>- Weight loss pills are more and more popular because they give quick results, through which we can see what fast is more dangerous and not good. Human health and weight also need training time, it can't be reduced quickly in 2-3weeks.</p>
					<p>- Mostly, there are many people who have to go to the doctor for help after a long time using weight loss pills. Then, they will fall into 2 cases. The first case is they can only lose weight for the first time, then the weight will level off or suddenly gain weight. Second, Lose weight well but the body is flabby and saggy. After taking weight loss pills, the body is tired, has problems with eating and sleeping, mentally exhausted.</p>
					<p>- To lose weight in a healthy way, we should do exercise every day so it can help our body to reduce fat. Not only is exercise important but eating a healthy diet is also very important to lose weight. We should create a healthy diet menu and it has to provide that this menu contains rich protein, nutritions, good fat, and vegetables. Cut off all junk food and soda drinks in your meal. You must focus on a nutritious diet, not depending on weight loss pills.</p>
					<h2>5. How it can be prevented.</h2>
					<p>- If not prevented from taking weight loss pills or overdoing it can lead to serious heart problems, palpitations, high blood pressure, breathing fast, increased feelings of stress, and mental health problems when you get old or an adult later in life.</p>
					<h2>6. How it can be prevented.</h2>
					<p>- After a period of taking weight loss pills, your body will lack a lot of serious nutrients. When you stop taking the drug, your body will be deprived of nutrients and fall into a state of storing energy with fat, so the more you eat, the more weight you will gain.</p>
					<p>-If you stop taking the weight loss pills, you have to change your diet and exercise regularly. Weight loss pills can help you lose weight immediately, but to keep your ideal weight after losing weight, you must have a low-calorie diet and do exercise more than usual to keep your weight. Weight loss pills are not the only solution, there are many healthy methods to lose weight without drugs including exercise, eating a healthy diet, not eating junk food, etc.</p>
